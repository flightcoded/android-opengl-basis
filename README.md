This repository contains everything needed to easily create an app with a fullscreen OpenGL activity.

## Setup ##

Create an empty project, add an empty activity for GraphicsActivity, add the classes to your package and you are ready to render! flyRenderer.java is where things happen, it renders a parallelogram out of the box as an example.
