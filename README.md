This repository contains everything needed to easily create an app with a fullscreen OpenGL activity. It works out of the box.

## Setup ##

Create an empty project, add an empty activity for GraphicsActivity, add the classes to your package, add the shaders to your /res/raw/ folder and you are ready to render!

Feel free to create an issue or contact me should you find an error or just want to.
