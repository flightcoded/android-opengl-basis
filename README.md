This repository contains everything needed to easily create an app with a fullscreen OpenGL activity. It works out of the box.

## Setup ##

Create an empty project, add an empty activity for GraphicsActivity, add the classes to your package and you are ready to render!

Feel free to create an issue or contact me should you find an error or just want to.
